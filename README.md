# Weather App with React

This project allows you to retrieve weather information for any location by entering the city name in the input box and clicking on "Get Data."

After doing so, you will receive the weather status of the specified location.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance

## Note:

To run this application locally, create a .env file in the root directory. Define a variable named REACT_APP_API_KEY and enter your secret API key received from OpenWeatherMap.

And voila! Your weather app is ready to work.
